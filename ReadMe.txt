The goal of the project is to be able to analyze the current FOREX 
stock exchange utilizing machine learning in Python. 

I think i want to add a scraper and a GUI that is capable of generating a printable report. 

The GUI has 4 main frames: Menu, Search, Graph, and News

Menu:
    - The Menu Frame is where the user will be able to access the settings for the program
    - Also the user to generate their own report
Search:
    - The Search frame includes the searchbar 
    - Will take in user input
Graph:
    - The Graph frame will show the current Market in a red line 
    - After it will then show a Projected output in yellow
News:
    - The News frame will scrape the web (Google, Forex, and Yahoo) for relevent News to cetain currencies
